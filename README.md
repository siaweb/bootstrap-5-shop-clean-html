The HTML store template on Bootstrap 5 is a powerful tool for creating an attractive and functional online store.

The responsive design of this template allows your site to look great on any device â€“ from mobile phones to desktop computers.

With the help of carousels and sliders, you can effectively present your products and attract the attention of visitors. But the functionality is limited within bootsrap 5.

The shopping cart and checkout are implemented in the Bootstrap 5 style, but it looks decent in my opinion.

The category and product pages are designed in a modern and stylish design from bootstrap 5, which makes site navigation convenient and enjoyable.

The product page displays detailed information about the product, and also provides the opportunity to add it to the cart or to the list of desired purchases.

The Category grid allows you to organize products by category, which makes it easier to find the right items to buy.

The Wishlist page and Compare page help users keep track of the products they like and compare them to each other to make the right decision.

Cart page and Checkout page allow customers to easily add products to the cart, change their quantity and place orders without leaving your site.

In general, the HTML store template on Bootstrap 5 is the perfect solution to demonstrate the capabilities of this powerful web application development tool. But there are not enough little things, as they say. Every time I develop, I have a question! And not to spit and add your own CSS and JS. But for me it's just a challenge. And so for everyone to familiarize themselves. PS And yes, I'm sure that something and somewhere could have been done better. XD You can write to me about it!!!
